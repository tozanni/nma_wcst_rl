# WCSTDehaeneChangeux
Code for an implementation of the Dehaene and Changeux's model of Wisconsin Card Sorting Test (1991).
<br/>
Model adaptated from Dehaene and Changeux model (1) , using neural networks, to perform Wisconsin Card Sorting Test and modellize flexibility of decision making. (DehaeneChangeux.py) The Statistics.py allows to launch the DehaeneChangeux.py script 500 times and to compute statistical parameters as the ones in the original paper.

<br/><br/>
How to use: <br/>
```bash
python DehaeneChangeux.py
python Statistics.py
```
<br/>
Numpy and Matplotlib libraries required.
<br/>
Creation of a directory named "activitiesPlot" where plots of activities are saved. Plots are rewrited when Statistics is relaunched.
